The Odin Project - Ruby: Basic Problems - http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks

This is a small collection of problem sets from the Ruby Programming curriculum at The Odin Project.


01 - Caesar Cipher

  A caesar cipher is an elementary encryption technique of shifting each character forward or backword by a particular key value. This problem required:
  
    - Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string
    - Don't forget to wrap from z to a
    - Don't forget to keep the same case

02 - Stock Picker

  A simple program to identify the best single trading opportunity between a set of prices, and report the correct days for the opportunity to the user, the problem required:
  
    - Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell

03 - Substrings

  A simple program to count the occurances of dictionary words in a given input. The problem required:
  
    - Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found
    - Make sure your method can handle multiple words
